# Node.js-Project
My project is a Node.js-based web app with user authentication, post management, and a dashboard feature. It enables secure registration, login, and CRUD operations for posts, with geolocation-based retrieval and dashboard statistics. Implemented tasks encompass server setup, JWT-based authentication, CRUD operations, geospatial querying.
